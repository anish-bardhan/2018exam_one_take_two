#nested if/else statements, nested for loops, and methods.

#to begin this lesson you must know how to use variables, arrays, if/else statements, and for loops.

#the term nesting refers to putting an if/else or for loop inside of another if/else or for loop. the process can be repeated many times.

#let's try and nest an if/else. use the array below.

arr1 = (1,3,5,7,9,11)

#nested if/else statements come in handy when you are looking for a value or variable that must meet specific requirements and conditions.

#to make a nested if/else statement you must indent the line underneath the first if/else statement and then rewrite the next if/else statement on that line. the process can be repeated continuously.

#use nested if, elif, and else statements to print any numbers greater than or equal to 7 and then print any number less than 9. this can be done other ways, but to complete the task you must use a nested if/else statement.



#use the following array in the next step.

arrr2 = (2,4,6,8,10,11)

#nested for loops are great for comparing arrays as well as singling out specific values in an array.

#to make a nested for loop you must indent the line underneath the first for loop and then rewrite the next for loop on that line. the process can be repeated continuously.

#use nested for loops to compare if any of the values inside the array is a duplicate between the two arrays.



#methods are a way to call a set of code without rewriting the code. it is essentially the same as setting an entire strand of code equal to a single variable.

#to create a method you need to use the code def NAMEOFMETHOD(arguments):. The arguments you enter refer to the type of input you will be using in your method. if you are using an array, the code would like somewhat like def NAMEOFMETHOD(arr):.

#below the code for the method you need to call the method. this can be done by writing the methods name and then the input information for the method. the code would like somewhat like NAMEOFMETHOD(nameofarray):.

#try making a method that prints your array.
